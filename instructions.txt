This project has two major dependencies, SDL2 and stb_image.
As stb_image is a header only library, no need to do anything except get the include paths right. but you can get the stb headers from https://github.com/nothings/stb.
In order to compile, you can either directly run the build.ps1/build.bat scripts or you can follow the given instructions to compile the project yourself.
The directories are structured in the following way:
	parent directory (i.e. the root directory)
	 │
         ├── code
	 │    ├── headers
	 │    │    └── *.h
	 │    ├── extern
	 │    │    ├── SDL2
	 │    │    └── stb_image.h
	 │    └── *.cpp
	 ├── data (assets)
	 └── build (will be generated)
And the way the internal and external header files are included in the code,
we'll have to set two separate include paths one to (relative to the parent directory)
./code/extern/
./code/headers/

Where the .lib files (for msvc and clang) or .a (files for mingw) is up to your discretion and you can get the lib files for SDL2 from https://www.libsdl.org/
so you'll have to link against SDL2.lib and SDL2main.lib
and the windows only .lib files are Shell32.lib and User32.lib
meaning the total headers you'll have to link against is
- SDL2.lib
- SDL2main.lib
- Shell32.lib
- User32.lib

Now onto the compilation,
